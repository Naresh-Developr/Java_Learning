Java Intro:
    Initially was called as oak.

    In java the java program compiled was converted into bytecode

    Byte code is a cross platform and ends with .class

    Byte code can be used in all platform like linux mac and pc's,

    The java virtual machine converts the byte code to machine code[object code]

    jvm is pre included in jdk.


Data Types:

Primitive && reference data Types

1. string is a reference data Type
2. reference data types are unlimited [because user defined]
3. reference always stores the address
4. reference can hold more than one value
5. reference has more memory
6. reference are slower.

//primitive:

only 8 types of primitive data 
stores data
can hold 1 value
less memory needed
fast.


//Wrapper classes in java.

wrapper classes used to use primitive data types as reference data types.

primitive       Wrapper

1. int          Integer
2. boolean      boolean
3. double       Double
4. char         Character


consider the above , you now understant that string is a wrapper class[reference data type],thats y it starts with Capital S

reference data types can be used with collections [ArrayList]

each primitive data type has its own wrapper class

Autoboxing:

    it is the automatic conversion that java compiler makes between primitive types 
and their corrosponding objects wrapper class.


unboxing:

    the reverse of Autoboxing, the automatic conversion of object wrapper class int primitive data types.
