1. 1 mile =  1.609km
2. celcius = (farenheit-32)*5/9
3. Area of circle = pi*r*r   // r---> radius
4. perimeter of circle = 2*pi*radius
5. area of sphere = 4*pi*radius
6. volume of sphere = 4/3*pi*radius*radius
7. percentage formula =  percentage/100 * toatl amount
8. area of cylinder = 2*pi*r*r + 2*pi*r
9. volume of cylinder = pi*r*r*h
10. speed = distance/time   // distance = distance*1000;--> to convert into meter
    speed = speed*1000/3600  --> km/hr  --> metre/second

formula to convert seconds to hours and mitues and seconds

total time[in seconds]/3600 --> to get hours from seconds // divide the remaining from this 
by 60 to get minutes and reaming are seconds.
11. compund interest = invested amount * (1+rate of interest)power[^]no.of.years 
12. right angled triangle = hypotunes square = square of sum of other two sides.

formula to check for valid triangle:

it must satisfies the below three conditions:
a+b>c
a+b>b
b+c>a
all must be true to make it as a triangle.

heron formula to check if it makes a triangle.
perimeter = a+b+c
s = 1/2*perimeter
area = squareroot_of(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)).
